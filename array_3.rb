puts string = "Welcome to America!" #string is a string.
puts a = string[6]  # a specifies an array value on the string-value. in this case nr7 key of "Welcome to america" = e
puts b = string[11] # b = same as above but in this case key #12 [11] = A
puts c = string[19] # c does the same thing, but the string doesn't span as far as the C array targets.

puts string.length # just to prove argument C, this shows string length is 19 characters long. C ask's for the 20:th character witch is nonegsistent.
